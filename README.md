# Hi, I'm Pranay, and this is the repo for my website!

I'm a data scientist based in Washington, D.C. I just graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's in both Statistics and Government. I love telling stories with data, whether about travel, sports, or international affairs. In fact, the centerpiece of my website is my data/narrative blog, PVP Productions, where I do just that!

I have a wealth of experience in Python and R, as well as statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Outside the world of data, I enjoy music composition, distance running, and urban exploration. Beyond PVP Productions, my website showcases many of my other works (music, journalism, projects, etc.) as well!
