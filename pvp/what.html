                                <h3>What is PVP Productions?</h3>
								<p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0"><span style="color: #fff01f; font-weight: 600">PVP PRODUCTIONS</span> is a project by me, <a href="../">Pranay Varada</a>.</p>
                                <p> Basically, I have a lot of questions, and sometimes I think the best way of answering them is by aggregating as much data as I physically can and just seeing what happens.
                                I set up this website in March 2024 to showcase my answers. So far, I've written about the peculiarities of time zones, the time I completed Vienna, and the greatest night in Moldovan football history. There will be more to come!</p>
                                <h3>Why is it called PVP Productions?</h3>
                                <p>The name "PVP Productions" is an intentional example of RAS syndrome.
                                    Probably the most common example of this in everyday life is referring to a "PIN number."
                                You don't need to say "PIN number" because "PIN" stands for "personal identification number."
                                You're being redundant. It's unnecessary. Stop it.
                                Even "RAS syndrome" is an example of RAS syndrome, since "RAS" stands for "redundant acronym syndrome."
                                You have to admit that's genius.
                                Anyway, "PVP" just stands for my name and then the word "Productions."
                                I didn't <i>have</i> to acronymize it, I just thought it sounded cooler. Sue me.</p>
                                <h3>What are the different tabs for?</h3>
                                <p>FEATURES is for long-form, serious stories and DISPATCHES is for more fun, less serious stuff.
									Right now, there's one of both up on the site. You can expect a good balance of FEATURES and DISPATCHES in the future.</p>
                                <p><i>
