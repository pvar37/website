                                <h3>What is PVP Productions?</h3>
								<p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0"><span style="color: #fff01f; font-weight: 600">PVP PRODUCTIONS</span> is a project by me, <a href="../">Pranay Varada</a>.</p>
                                <p> I have a lot of questions, and sometimes I think the best way of answering them is by aggregating a bunch of data and just seeing what happens.
                                I set up this website in March 2024 to showcase my answers. To name a few, I've written about <a href="i-found-every-international-flight/">every international flight in the world</a>, <a href="land-of-the-setting-sun.html">the peculiarities of time zones</a>, and <a href="far-from-home.html">the people who lived farther away from home than anyone else in history</a>. There will be more to come!</p>
                                <h3>Why is it called PVP Productions?</h3>
                                <p>The name "PVP Productions" is an intentional example of RAS syndrome.
                                    Probably the most common example of this in everyday life is referring to a "PIN number."
                                You don't need to say "PIN number" because "PIN" stands for "personal identification number."
                                You're being redundant. It's unnecessary. Stop it.
                                Even "RAS syndrome" is an example of RAS syndrome, since "RAS" stands for "redundant acronym syndrome."
                                You have to admit that's genius.
                                Anyway, "PVP" just stands for my name and then the word "Productions."
                                I didn't <i>have</i> to acronymize it, I just thought it sounded cooler. Sue me.</p>
                                <h3>What are the different tabs for?</h3>
                                <p>FEATURES is for long-form stories and DISPATCHES is for shorter, more fun stuff, like <a href="speedrunning-vienna.html">the weekend I visited every district in Vienna</a> or <a href="one-song-in-every-language/">that time I listened to one song in every language</a>. Regardless of their classification, I draw on some combination of geography, politics, history, sports, and data across these projects.</p>
